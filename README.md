# ThinkingFaces
Collection of animated spinners and bouncers for iOS. Thanks very much for looking at this repo. Hopefully these classes can form the starting point to your own custom activity indicator, or 'thinking face.'  

## Contributing 👏
Contributions always welcome. If you have a new idea for a fun spinner or bouncer, or see something that could be improved, please open a PR.

## Usage 🌟
Playgrounds built with Xcode 9.3 🛠
All components are a single class, and come packaged within a playground. Tweak any parameters or timing curves you'd like, and then copy the code out into your own project. All of the classes come with built-in accessors for timing, tint, and other params.
